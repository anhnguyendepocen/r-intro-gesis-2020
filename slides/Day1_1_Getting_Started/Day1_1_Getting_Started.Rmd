# About this course

In this course, we will provide an introduction to the basic concepts and functionalities of `R` and go through a prototypical data analysis workflow: import, wrangling, exploration, (basic) analysis, and reporting. 

By the end of this course you should...

- be comfortable with using *R* and *RStudio*
- be able to import, wrangle, and explore your data with *R*
- be able to conduct basic visualizations and analyses of your data with *R*

**Note**: This is not a statistics workshop. Our focus will be on learning how to use *R*.

# Our jou`R`neys

Johannes

- was socialized with *SPSS*
- was annoyed with *AMOS* when learning structural equation modeling (around 2010)
- decided to learn to use the [`lavaan`](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) package for `R` instead of *MPlus* to avoid being dependent on yet another proprietary software package
- only used `R` for SEM for some time, while still doing everything else (esp. data wrangling) with *SPSS*
- finally made the full transition to `R` when joining *GESIS* in 2017

# What is `R`?

>R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS ([`R` Project website](https://www.r-project.org/)).

`R` is [free and open-source software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and also a programming language. More specifically, it is a free, non-commercial implementation of the [`S` programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language) (developed by Bell Laboratories).

---

# Why use `R`?

- it is free an open-source

--

- it is modular through the use of packages
  - You want to do X with `R`? There's ~~an app~~ a package for that!
  - The universe of packages for `R` keeps on expanding
  
--
  
- it can be used for almost all steps in the research process: data collection, processing, exploration, analysis, and reporting/publishing

--

- it offers extremely powerful and versatile options for data visualization

--

- it has a great community with groups like [*R-Ladies*](https://rladies.org/), the [*R Consortium*](https://www.r-consortium.org/), or [*rOpenSci*](https://ropensci.org/)
  - also check out the [*#rstats* hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query)
  
--

- it is becoming increasingly popular in [academic publications](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/), [programming communities like Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), and also in [job advertisements](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)

--

- it is fun!

---

# Fun with `R`

You can use `R` to...

- read [Chuck norris jokes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/norris/index.html)

--

- [create memes](https://github.com/sctyner/memer)
  - there's also a whole [genre of `R` memes](https://github.com/favstats/rstatsmemes)

--

- [create 3D LEGO mosaics from images](http://www.ryantimpe.com/post/lego-mosaic3/)
  - ... and even find out [which LEGO bricks you need to build them for real](https://github.com/ryantimpe/brickr)

--

- [play](https://github.com/gsimchoni/CastleOfR) or [create text adventures](https://lucidmanager.org/text-adventure/)

--

- [create objects in *Minecraft*](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/miner_book/)

--

- make all sorts of [dice rolls for your pen & paper/tabletop role-playing games](https://github.com/Felixmil/rollR)

---

# (My take on) `R` vs. `Python`

- both are great

- `Python` is more powerful for data collection and offer more options for machine learning

- `R` is more powerful for data visualization and statistics

- you can use both together, e.g., via the [`reticulate` package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)
  - however, I would not recommend learning them in parallel (to avoid language confusion)

---

# (My take on) `R` vs. `Python`
  
- in terms of setting up and maintaining your installation, `R` is quite a bit easier to handle

```{r python tweet}
tweet_embed("https://twitter.com/johncassil/status/1281277159642972160",

```

---

# Installing `R`

You can download `R` via the [`R` Project website](https://www.r-project.org/). The exact installation process depends on your operating system (OS). The *R Cookbook* provides a [detailed explanation of the installation process for Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix](https://rc2e.com/gettingstarted#recipe-id001).

If you want or need to update your version of `R`, you can do this the same way as for the first-time installation. If you use *Windows*, you can also use the [`installr` package](https://github.com/talgalili/installr) to update `R` (we will talk about packages in a bit).

---

# Graphical user interfaces (GUI) for `R`

`R` comes with a basic GUI (on *Windows* you can access it by opening the `Rgui.exe` file). However, it is quite limited in terms of its functions.

```{r, basic R GUI, out.width = "95%"}
include_graphics("./pics/base_R_gui.png")
```

---

# Graphical user interfaces (GUI) for `R`

A more comprehensive GUI for `R` is [*R Commander*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html) which essentially is a package for `R` that can be used via the basic GUI that comes with `R` or the `R` command line tool (`R.exe` on Windows).

```{r, R commander, out.width = "45%"}
include_graphics("./pics/r_commander.png")
```

---

# Text editors and intergrated development interfaces (IDE) for `R`

Using powerful text editors or an IDE provides several advantages:
  - syntax highlighting
  - auto-completion
  - better overview of files, libraries, created objects/output

`R` can be used, e.g., with
  - [`gedit`](http://rgedit.sourceforge.net/)
  - `Emacs` via [ESS (Emacs speaks statistics)](https://ess.r-project.org/)
  - [`vim`](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628)

The most easy-to-use IDE that is specifically tailored to `R` is [`RStudio`](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) which is also what we will use for this workshop.

---

# Installing `RStudio`

You can download the installer for your OS from the [`RStudio` website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
