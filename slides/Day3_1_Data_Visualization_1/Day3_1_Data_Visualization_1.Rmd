## Why should we use data visualization?
While this is no statistics course and also we figure that all of you are also familiar with the concept of data visualization, we again want you to list why we think it's important.

### In general
- Good plots can contribute to a better understanding of your analysis results
  - Plots also help you to understand your data in the first place (see the exploratory analysis session)
- Generating a plot is easy as you will see
  - Making good plots, however, can take very long
  
### Plots in `R`
- `R` is fun, and so is creating plots in `R`
- Almost every plot type is supported in R
  - either in your standard installation or in an additional package
- A large number of exports formats are supported
  - png, jpg, tif, svg, bmp, pdf, eps etc.

## Graphics in R
Since the early days, graphics are a first class citizen in R

A standard `R` installation doesn't require any additional packages to create graphics. It's part of the `graphics` package.


```{r load_gp_covid, include = FALSE}
gp_covid <- 
  haven::read_sav(
    "../../data/gesis_panel_covid19/ZA5667_v1-1-0.sav"
  ) %>% 
  sjlabelled::set_na(na = c(-1:-99, 97))
```

.pull-left[
```{r graphics_hist, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$hzcy001a)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "graphics_hist", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Ok, but let's start from the beginning
The most basic function to plot in R is `plot()`.

.pull-left[
```{r basic_plot, eval = FALSE}
plot(gp_covid$hzcy001a)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "basic_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## We can turn this into a bivariate scatterplot
.pull-left[
```{r basic_scatter, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  gp_covid$age_cat, 
  gp_covid$hzcy001a
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "basic_scatter", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Add some jitter and also change the points type
.pull-left[
```{r basic_scatter_jittered, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "basic_scatter_jittered", echo = FALSE}
```
]


---

## Adding stuff to the plot: titles & labels
.pull-left[
```{r titles_labels, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16,
  main = "Relationship between Age and Subjective Likelihood of a COVID-19 Infection",
  xlab = "Age of Respondents",
  ylab = "Likelihood of Being Infected"
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "titles_labels", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Adding stuff to the plot: axis labels
.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r axis_labels, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16,
  main = "Relationship between Age and Likelihood of Covid-19 Infection",
  xlab = "Age of Respondents",
  ylab = "Likelihood of Being Infected",
  yaxt = "n"
)
axis(
  side = 2, 
  at = 1:7,
  labels = c(
    "Not at all",
    "Very\nunlikely", 
    "Rather\nunlikely",
    "Moderately",
    "Rather", 
    "Very",
    "Absolutely"
  ),
  las = 0
)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "axis_labels", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Record your plot
By adding more and more elements to your plot also means that the code you have to write gets more and more. Later in this session, we will learn how to wrap your plots in a function to create multiple plots at once. But what can we do when we just want to re-use the same plot again and dynamically add some stuff. We can record the plot!

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r record_plot, eval = FALSE}
plot(
  jitter(gp_covid$age_cat, 2), 
  jitter(gp_covid$hzcy001a, 2),
  pch = 16,
  main = "Relationship between Age and Likelihood of Covid-19 Infection",
  xlab = "Age of Respondents",
  ylab = "Likelihood of Being Infected",
  yaxt = "n"
)

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "record_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Now apply it to the previous plot

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r apply_recording, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
axis(
  side = 2, 
  at = 1:7,
  labels = c(
    "Not at all",
    "Very\nunlikely", 
    "Rather\nunlikely",
    "Moderately",
    "Rather", 
    "Very",
    "Absolutely"
  ),
  las = 0
)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "apply_recording", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## If you're happy, just update your recording

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r happy_recording, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
axis(
  side = 2, 
  at = 1:7,
  labels = c(
    "Not at all",
    "Very\nunlikely", 
    "Rather\nunlikely",
    "Moderately",
    "Rather", 
    "Very",
    "Absolutely"
  ),
  las = 0
)

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "happy_recording", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Annotating the plot: Adding a regression line

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r regression_line, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
abline(
  lm(
    hzcy001a ~ age_cat, 
    data = gp_covid
  ),
  col = "red"
)

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "regression_line", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Annotating the plot: Adding a legend
.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r legend, eval = FALSE}
my_scatterplot
legend(
  8, 
  7.5, 
  legend = "Regression Line",
  col = "red",
  lty = 1
  )

my_scatterplot <- recordPlot()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "legend", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## More options and more plots
We will again turn to this example later in this week during the confirmatory analysis session. What you may have learned so far is that already with a few options you can dramatically change the output of the default plotting function in `R`.

The idea is always to first initiate the plot and that add more and more stuff to the plot. In the same logic, e.g., by calling the `axis()` function you would also delete elements of the plot.

We could now also adjust some more parameters, such as colors, axis limits etc., but this may create an example that is somewhat far-fetched. Instead, we will learn from other standard plotting functions in `R`, and will apply more options there.

---

## Histograms
Although we will turn to exploratory data analysis tomorrow, histograms and similar plots are really handy if you want to have a glimpse on the distribution of a variable. See, the distribution of the categorized age variable in the GESIS Panel:

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r hist_basic, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "hist_basic", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Introduce axis limits
You can then pose axis limits using the option `xlim`, if you are only interested in the range of data.

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r hist_limits, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$age_cat, xlim = c(1, 5))
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "hist_limits", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---
## Adding breaks
The `breaks` option is great to limit or expand the number of bins and their width in the data.

.tinyish[
.pull-left[
```{r hist_breaks, eval = FALSE}
hist(gp_covid$age_cat, breaks = 10)
```
]
]


.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "hist_breaks", echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
```
]

However, age in our data are categorical data and, therefore, we may want to use a plotting technique that is more appropriate: barplots.

---

## Barplots
The command `barplot()` generates a barplot from a frequency table. So we need to build it first. Fortunately, that's really easy and something you will need all the time. For example, to create a frequency table for the categorized age variable in the GESIS Panel use:


.pull-left[
```{r}
table_age <- table(gp_covid$age_cat)
```

We can then create our barplot from that

```{r barplot, eval = FALSE}
barplot(table_age)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "barplot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Make it colorful: adding blue colors
Everything's so far was more or less grayish, so we use the example of barplots to first create blue bars for our barplot. For this purpose, we use the `rgb()` function. You could also add hex codes as character strings (see below).

.pull-left[
```{r bar_blue, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(0, 0, 1)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_blue", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Green colour 
Here's a green version...

.pull-left[
```{r bar_green, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(0, 1, 0)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_green", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Red colour
...and a red one.

.pull-left[
```{r bar_red, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(1, 0, 0)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_red", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Transparency (alpha value)
Granted, this looks a little bit oldschool. What boosts the appearance a little bit are alpha-values. They make the colors transparent.

.pull-left[
```{r bar_alpha, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = rgb(1, 0, 0, .3)
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_alpha", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Rstudio addin `colourpicker`
Choosing colors is not always an easy task. The `colourpicker` adding for `Rstudio` helps you choosing colors.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("colourpicker")
```

```{r out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/colourpicker.PNG")
```

---

## Set various colors

.pull-left[
```{r bar_more_colors, eval = FALSE}
barplot(
  table_age, 
  col = c(20, "#62D6C8", "darkorange")
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_more_colors", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## A two dimensional table

```{r}
table_age_likelihood <- 
  table(gp_covid$age_cat, gp_covid$hzcy001a)

table_age_likelihood
```

If the passed table object is two-dimensional, a conditional barplot is created.

---

## Conditional barplot: stacked
The barplot for a two-dimensional table object can either be stackend (default).

.pull-left[
```{r bar_stacked, eval = FALSE}
barplot(table_age_likelihood)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_stacked", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Conditional barplot: side by side
Or it can be plotted side by side.

.pull-left[
```{r bar_side, eval = FALSE}
barplot(table_age_likelihood, beside = TRUE)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "bar_side", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## More plot types you can choose from
Boxplots
- `boxplot(y ~ x)`

Pie charts (still possible in 2020)
- `pie(x)`

Scatterplot matrices
- `pairs(x)`

Mosaic Plots
- `mosaicplot(table)`

Densities
- `plot(density(x))`

---

## Integrating plots in functions/packages
Creating plots in R is not complicated. Since the real advantage of R is the community with additional packages and routines, it's clear that the real benefit is this accessible interface to plotting techniques.

This is why `plot()` often is a generic function not only to plot data directly. Some statistical models have their own plotting method, which is called when you use the `plot()` command.

---

## Example: OLS model
.pull-left[
```{r lm_summary_plot, eval = FALSE}
linear_model <- 
  lm(
    hzcy001a ~ age_cat, 
    data = gp_covid
  )

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(linear_model)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "lm_summary_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## The `par()` and `dev.off()` function
`par()` stands for graphical parameters and is called before the actual plotting function. It prepares the graphics device in `R` so that it knows: hey, plot(s) incoming. So a lot can be done within this function, the most often used options are for indeed telling the device that 2, 3, 4, or `x` have to be printed in the device.

For this purpose we have used the option `mfrow` before by telling it how many rows (the first value in the vector) and columns (the second value in the vector) we aim to plot. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
```

One caveat of using this function is that the actively have to turn off the device before we want to generate another independent plot with.

```{r eval = FALSE}
dev.off()
```

This afternoon, we will learn from the `patchwork` package which makes assembling plots much easier.

---

## Added-value plotting methods in other packages
What is more is than other package developer provide new R functions that, in the background, make use of R's plotting techniques. These packages rescue you from writing lengthy R-scipts just to get a specific layout of a plot.

---

## A correlation plot
.pull-left[
```{r corr_plot, eval = FALSE}
gp_covid %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    age_cat, 
    hzcy001a, 
    political_orientation, 
    education_cat
  ) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete.obs", method = "spearman") %>% 
  corrplot::corrplot(method = "color")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "corr_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Fancy panels
.pull-left[
```{r panels_plot, eval = FALSE}
gp_covid %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    age_cat, 
    hzcy001a, 
    political_orientation, 
    education_cat
  ) %>% 
  psych::pairs.panels()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "panels_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## But sometimes that's not enough
In a way, ready-made functions for nice plots requires again to learn new commands, options, and the like. And sometimes you may have requirements that cannot evenfulfilled with these functions anyway.

While these functions are helpful to combine information from different variables in a dataset, sometimes you also want to re-create the same old boring graph over and over again, e.g., for plotting results from similar but different statistical models.

So may want to exploit your skills on looping.

---

## Let's create some analysis results

```{r}
dependent_variables <-
  c("hzcy001a", "hzcy002a", "hzcy003a", "hzcy004a", "hzcy005a")

linear_models <-
  lapply(dependent_variables, function (dv) {
    lm(gp_covid[[dv]] ~ age_cat, data = gp_covid)
  }) %>% 
  magrittr::set_names(dependent_variables)
```

---

## The plot that we want to re-create multiple times
.pull-left[
```{r base_predictions_plot, eval = FALSE}
library(margins)
invisible(
  capture.output(
    cplot(
      linear_models[["hzcy001a"]], 
      main = "hzcy001a"
    )
  )
)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "base_predictions_plot", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Wrap your plot in a function
```{r}
fancy_pants_margins_plot <- function (my_models) {
  
  # define layout
  par(mfrow = c(ceiling(length(my_models)/2), 2))
  
  # plot all models
  for (model in names(my_models)) {
    invisible(
      capture.output(
        cplot(
          my_models[[model]],
          main = model
          
          # add plot parameter(s) whichever you want
          # ...
          
        )
      )
    )
  }
}
```

---

## Run our function
.pull-left[
```{r fancy_pants_margins_plotted, eval = FALSE}
fancy_pants_margins_plot(linear_models)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "fancy_pants_margins_plotted", echo = FALSE}
```
]

---

## Outlook on the next session
In the next session, we will work with the **tidyverse** and its plotting techniques using `ggplot2`. We will learn an alternative  and easier way of plotting data or results from different models exploiting so-called facets.  However, the trade-off is that the input data for the plots require more attention and simply more preparation.

---

## Exporting graphics
It's nice that R provides such nice plotting opportunities.

However, to include them in our papers, we need to export them.

As said in the beginning, numerous exports formats are baked-in into R.

---

## Export with Rstudio

```{r echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("./pics/saveGraphic.PNG")
```

---

## Saving graphics via a command
Alternatively also with the commands `png()`, `pdf()` or `jpeg()`, for example. For this purpose, you first have wrap the plot call between one of those functions and a `dev.off()`call.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
png("Histogram.png")
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
dev.off()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdf("Histogram.pdf")
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
dev.off()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jpeg("Histogram.jpeg")
hist(gp_covid$age_cat)
dev.off()
```

It's that easy.

---

## My personal note on R base plotting
Hopefully, you may have gotten the feeling that already `R`'s base techniques for plotting are well-suited for daily data exploration. On some days, `hist()` is my most often used command.

But to be honest: I use all the other functions not that often, particularly from all the added-value packages for plotting. The syntax is sometimes cumbersome with all the `par()`  or `dev.off()` calls, and manipulating parameters simply feels 'old'.

In the next session, we will learn more modern techniques using `tidyverse`/`ggplot2`. Yet, we still believe that it is worthwhile to get comfortable with base R plotting since `ggplot2` sometimes can simply too much for simple data exploration.

In the end, it's also a matter of taste. For real.
